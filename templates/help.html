<p><b> Game Instruction </b></p>

<p> Before you begin playing Hold'em, you'll want to learn the rules. In Hold'em, each player is dealt two private cards (known as 'hole cards') that belong to them alone. Five community cards are dealt face-up, to form the 'board'. All players in the game use these shared community cards in conjunction with their own hole cards to each make their best possible five-card poker hand. In Hold'em, a player may use any combination of the seven cards available to make the best possible five-card poker hand, using zero, one or two of their private hole cards. The ranking of poker hands is: Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Three of a kind, Two pair, One pair, High card. <br>http://www.pokerstars.com/poker/games/texas-holdem/ </p>
